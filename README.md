Extinct mammal dataset
# Extinct Mammal Dataset  

## Overview  
This dataset documents extinct mammal species, including their scientific names, taxonomic orders, estimated extinction dates, and former ranges. It serves as a resource for understanding biodiversity loss and the historical distribution of extinct mammals.  

## Data Fields  
- **Common Name** – The widely recognized name of the extinct mammal.  
- **Binomial Name** – The scientific (Latin) name of the species.  
- **Order** – The taxonomic order to which the species belongs.  
- **Date of Extinction** – The estimated or recorded extinction date.  
- **Former Range** – The historical distribution before extinction.  
  
## Usage  
This dataset is useful for:  
- Conservation research and biodiversity analysis.  
- Visualizing extinction patterns across mammalian taxa.  
- Educational purposes in environmental science and zoology.
